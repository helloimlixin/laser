# LASER

The [original development repository](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/dlgan-0CCD) is a little bit messy, so I decided 
to create a new one with a clean structure.

## Structure

- `data/`: contains the data used in the experiments.
- `experiments/`: contains the experiments.
- `laser/`: contains the LASER model.
- `scripts/`: contains scripts to run the experiments.
- `tests/`: contains tests for the LASER model.
- `utils/`: contains utility functions.
- `README.md`: this file.
- `requirements.txt`: contains the dependencies.
- `setup.py`: contains the setup configuration.
- `LICENSE`: contains the license.
- `.gitignore`: contains the files to ignore in the repository.

## Installation
